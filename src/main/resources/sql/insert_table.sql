        During summertime, visitors flock to the Alps to go hiking, cycling, and mountain climbing. In the winter, the French Alps draws many tourists for alpine skiing, snowboarding, and cross-country skiing. Other things to do during the snowy season include ice-skating, dog sledding rides, and old-fashioned horse-drawn sleigh rides.

        Besides the spectacular mountain terrain, the region also has a rich cultural heritage linked to the ancestral territory of the Italian royal House of Savoy, as well as the historic Dauphiné region. The lovely mountain village of Chamonix (about a 15-minute drive from the base of Mont Blanc) offers traditional alpine ambience, while Annecy (just over a one-hour drive from Chamonix) has an ancient château, lakeside scenery, and fairy-tale ambience.

Huge Doric columns also decorate the two buildings at each side of the Gate, once used by toll-collectors and guards.

Undoubtedly Berlin's most iconic structure, it's hard to believe that the majestic structure you see today was severely damaged during WWII and was also once part of the infamous Berlin Wall and, for a few decades, was symbolic of the division of Berlin into East and West.',''
